# DevToysWeb

This is yet another version of [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys). It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and you can access it from the following URL:

https://devtoys.vercel.app

It is being developed with the following goals in mind:

* It should work on any OS by running on the web.
  * At the same time, it should work in a completely offline environment as a PWA (although this has not been implemented yet).
* It should have almost the same functionality and appearance as the original.
  * Support for dark mode and i18n is also important.

Therefore, I'm currently planning to follow the original project in the future development.
